    <h1>Ashika Island Loadouts</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Ashika Island Loadouts<br>Here, we share the best loadouts for ashika island resurgence. Some are built by me, others by youtubers such as Hero, Cbass and SallyIsADog. For suggestions please email <i> warzone.2.loadouts@gmail.com</i>. This site is under construction and the subdomains are constantly being updated. I may purchase a domain in the near future; the old url will still work, but the new one will be a .net. Thank you for visiting this page as it helps my google ranking. Feel free to share this link with your friends and in comments sections, so long as you are not spamming. Cool sidenote: if you press ctrl + u you can see the source code, where I jot down my thoughts whilst coding, including this page!</p>
