    <h1><strong>Assault Rifle Classes</strong></h1>
    <p>The assault rifle is an automatic weapon, perfect for mid to long range engagements, but with attachements and tuning, can be turned into a fast and zippy SMG, or a long ranged LMG. On Ashika Island, you will typically be using the former (Our Al Mazrah Site is under construction). The M4 is known as a jack-of-all-trades, whilst the Chimera, M13B and Kastov 74u are see as more agile, close range weapons. We also have slight attachment switches to bump up the range, should you feel it necessary. (The numbers are in the order they appear, and are not our ranking of them)</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <ol>
      <li><h2><strong>M4</strong></h2><br><p>For our first weapon we will go over the M4, a versatile weapon useful for both al mazrah and ashika. Our class will focus on ADS and sprint to fire with some focus on recoil control, that still maintains a decent damage output at range. (Credit: LA Guerillas) This is the build:<ul class="ARlist">
        <li>Muzzle: Echoline GS-X, +0.72oz, +0.52in</li>
        <li>Barrel: Tempus Trench Pro, +0.31lb, -0.15in</li>    <!--Ive just realised how hard this going to be-->
        <li>Optic: Cronen Mini Pro, -1.45oz, 0.00</li>
        <li>Rear Grip: XTEN Grip, -0.61oz, -0.29in</li>
        <li>Stock: Tempus P80 Stock, -1.94oz, +1.24in</li>
      </ul><br>
      <div class="Extra">Note: <u>Should you feel some extra ranged damage is necessary, and are willing to sacrifice some ADS and sprint to fire speed, you could consider swapping out the Tempus Trench<br>for the Hightower 20" and/or the Echoline for the Harbinger D20.</u></div></p></li>   <!--The (note:) gave me so much crap in css it took a solid hour to get it to look good-->
      <li><h2><strong>TAQ-56</strong></h2><br><p>Up next is the Taq, a fan favourite of the CoD franchise. The Taq (Called the Scar in other titles of the franchise) has been a solid choice in all 3 seasons, bearing a cosy low-rent contract for my number 2 loadout slot, accompanied by the Vaznev. SallyIsADog did a video on the gun, which is what class we will be basing the gun off of, with only a minor change. This gun is a fantastic all rounder that I would trust with both my in-game life and my IRL life. Unfortunately we do not have the tunings, but here is the class:<ul class="ARlist">
        <li>Barrel: 17" Tundra Pro Barrel</li>
        <li>Muzzle: Komodo Heavy</li>
        <li>Under Barrel: FTac Ripper 56</li>            <!--First meta weapon I ever added to my loadout...those were the days-->
        <li>Rear Grip: FSS Combat Grip</li>
        <li>Stock: TV Cardinal Stock</li>
      </ul></p></li>
      <li><h2><strong>KASTOV-762</strong></h2><p>The kastov 762 is like the RPK combined with the AK (Kastov 545). The Kastovia platform has long since been recognised for putting out some stunning weapons, such as the season 1 Meta RPK, the Minibak (known as the bullfrog in Warzone 1), and the vaznev, a streamer favourite for SnD in competitive play. The 762 is intended for longer ranges than the 545, and this class has amazing damage range, whilst boasting an impressive ADS and Sprint to Fire speed. (Credit: Hero) This is the loadout:<ul class="ARlist">
        <li>Muzzle: Polarfire-S, -0.450z, +0.71in</li>
        <li>Laser: FSS Ole-V Laser </li>
        <li>Under Barrel: FTac Ripper 56, +0.46oz, +0.17in</li>   <!--I literally cannot tell the difference between this and the 545-->
        <li>Magazine: 40 Round Mag</li>
        <li>Rear Grip: Demo-X2 Grip, -0.65oz, -0.13in</li>
      </ul></p></li>
      <li><h2><strong>LACHMANN-556</strong></h2><p>This Lachmann class is taken from one of opixz's videos, where he uses it as a zero recoil sniper support class, despite it's longer range build. He completely beams someone gliding overhead, burning through spawn protection with easy-to-achieve headshots. This looks amazing in solid white camo, and is the mirror image of the grau from warzone 1. This is part of the lachmann platform, and can be unlocked by levelling up the 762, which is trash aat base, but with the class here at "our url dot com", it will be a full automatic slapper. Without further ado, here is the build:<ul class="ARlist">
        <li>Muzzle: Echoless-80</li>
        <li>Barrel: 15.9" RAPP Barrel</li>             <!--I tried so hard to find the video he featured it in but couldnt :(  -->
        <li>Laser: FSS Ole-V Laser</li>                <!--I remember the clip, the dude just gets knocked 50m up in the air LOL-->
        <li>Stock: LM-S Factory G79 Stock</li>
        <li>Mag: 40 Round Mag</li>
      </ul></p></li>
      <li><h2><strong>STB-556</strong></h2><p>The bruen ops platform features LMGs and SMGs, but perhaps it's most notable weapon is the 556. Cbass describes as a "Meta weapon". With that being said though, it is one that is srmi under the radar, so as to avoid getting your mother cussed out in the deathmic. This class is usually used in close ranged engagements, but can be easily used at longer ranges. This build destroys my SnD lobbies as well as placing me first on the shipment leader board, and performed exceptionaly well in solos. I found it looks good in a spray paint camo, with a green/black background with orange dots. This is the setup:<ul class="ARlist">
        <li>Stock: Bruen MX9 Stock, -2.58oz, -1.47in</li>         <!--I really like the camo. If I remember Ill add the name here:( )-->
        <li>Muzzle: Sakin Tread-40, +0.61oz, +0.19in</li>
        <li>Comb: FTac C11 Riser, -0.15oz, -0.12in</li>
        <li>Rear Grip: Bruen Q900 Grip</li>                       <!--If u dont like the ironsights ur insane-->
        <li>Under Barrel: FSS Sharkfin 90, +0.52oz, +0.28in</li>
      </ul><br></p>
    <div class="Extra">Note: <u>If you struggle with recoil, swap out the sharkfin for the phase 3 grip. I personally have no problem with the ironsights, but if you dislike them then add the Cronen Mini Pro and remove the mx9 stock.</u></div></li>
    <li><h2><strong>M16</strong></h2><p>The M16 is regarded as the most godwaful, musty crusty dogshit gun in the game, but I promised my self I would make a class for every gun in the game, so here goes. Through my testing I realised that it wasn't too bad if your enemy was already weak and wasn't returning fire, in other words: dead. This think takes <u>TWO</u> bursts to kill in MW2 if you miss more than one shot. You heard me: Modern. Warfare. Two. You can do it in one, but you need a headshot, and don't even get me started on Warzone. For some reason the top three videos online were all by Hero (who literally says,"The M16 needs another buff to even be effective for ranked"), so naturally this will be his build:<ul class="ARlist">
      <li>Muzzle: Komodo Heavy, +0.57oz, +0.18in</li>
      <li>Under Barrel: Commando Foregrip, +0.36oz, +0.30in</li>
      <li>Ammunition: High Velocity, +0.32g, +5.81gr</li>    <!--I feel like Im still understating the absolute shiteness of this gun-->
      <li>Optic: Slimline Pro, -1.35oz, -2.25in</li>
      <li>Rear Grip: Xten Grip, -0.48oz, -0.28in</li>
    </ul></p></li>
    <li><h2><strong>Kastov-74u</strong></h2><p>This gun is pretty good off of ground loot, and has pretty good mobility, similar to the chimera or M13B. The Chiron blueprint that came in the season 1 battlepass for free (or season 2 idk) is okay, but has worse ADS than SMGs and worse recoil than SMGs, so basically a crappy, rip-off vaznev. That being said, I feel that blueprint doesn't do justice to how good you can make this. CBass made this class, and it can two shot, which ss pretty impressive. This is the loadout:<ul class="ARlist">
      <li>Stock: Markeev R7 Stock, -4.00oz, -0.62in</li>
      <li>Optic: Monocle CT90, +2.90oz, -1.74in</li>           <!--Wierd AF optic but it actually has a really good view, just try it-->
      <li>Rear Grip: True-Tac, -0.71oz, -0.30in</li>           <!--Also was I too mean saying it was a crappy rip off vaznev???-->
      <li>Under Barrel: FSS Sharkfin 90, +0.80oz, +0.17in</li>
      <li>Muzzle: Ftac Castle Comp, +0.57oz, +0.29in</li>
    </ul></p></li>
    <li><h2><strong>Kastov-545</strong></h2><p>Ah yes..the 762's identical twin. Performance is almost the same so I'm going to keep this part brief; slightly less range, but slightly better mobility. I really don't think one is better than the other, but this class 3 shots, and it has a pretty decent fire rate. Once again CBass is the loadout creating GOAT:<ul class="ARlist">
      <li>Stock: Broadside FCT, -1.03oz, -0.93in</li>
      <li>Rear Grip: True-Tac Grip, -0.77oz, -0.9in</li>
      <li>Muzzle: Cronen OP44, +0.65oz, +0.26in</li>
      <li>Optic: Cronen Mini Pro, +2.71oz, -1.50oz</li>
      <li>Foregrip: FSS Sharkfin 90, +0.57oz, +0.40in</li>
    </ul></p><div class="Extra">Note: <u>CBass is so good he has like 4 variations based on playstyle, which are too much too list here, so check the link to all the loadouts I used <a href="../Notes/classes ashika.txt">here</a></u></div></li>    <!--Theres a link to a subdomain on this page in chimera <p> that needs adding-->
    <li><h2><strong>Chimera</strong></h2><p>The Chimera has one of the best base mobility atats, which will be reflected in this build. This build is not the one I use, but the one I use will be listed <a href="">here</a>. I quit like the chimera, but it is fairly difficult to use at range. This build will feature more SMG-like tuning because that is pretty much the only feasable way to build this class, made by CBass:<ul class="ARlist">
      <li>Rear Grip: Bruen Flash Grip, -0.68oz, -0.19in</li>
      <li>Stock: Ravage-10, -4.00oz, -2.40in</li>
      <li>Magazine: 45 round mag</li>
      <li>Underbarrel: FSS Sharkfin 90, +0.36oz, +0.40in</li>
    </ul></p><div class="Extra">Note: <u>If you look at the build, carefully, you can see there are only 4 attachements, which leaves you free to add either an optic or the VLK LZR 7MW</u></div></li>
    <li><h2><strong>M13B</strong></h2><p>The M13B is very similar to the Chimera, sharing it's closer range style. It is an absolute pain to unlock in DMZ, but I believe it's worth it. I would also like to say that I <u>do not</u> belive you should by this from the store. This following class setup was built for MW2, but I believe it will still fair well with Ashika Island's longer engagement distances, due to great recoil control, a base mag size of 38 rounds, with an insane Fire Rate. This is the build by Hero:<ul class="ARlist">  <!--Tbh I think its hilarious me waffling whilst I dont even have it-->
      <li>Muzzle: FJX Fulcrum Pro, +0.52oz, +0.30in</li>
      <li>Laser: VLK LZR 7MW, -0.24oz, -23.03ft</li>
      <li>Magazine: 45 round mag</li>
      <li>Optic: Slimline Pro, -2.71oz, -2.25in</li>
      <li>Rear Grip: D37 Grip, -0.90oz, -0.30in</li>
    </ul></p></li>
    <li><h2><strong>ISO Hemlock</strong></h2></li><p>Last, but definetely not the least, we have the ISO. Crazy damage at range, good ADS, amazing mobility, and the OG Kilo. Am I picking favourites? Yes. Is it without reason? No. Not at all. It took me less than 45 mins in Mercado to max level this thing from level one to the top. I remember that literally everyone except one person on my team was using this gun, with the VLK. Due to these reasons I present to you the class, built for the best mobility, best damage range, from scratch by your's truly:<ul class="ARlist">
      <li>Optic: SZ Recharge-DX, -2.42oz, -1.95in</li>
      <li>Stock: R-COM-S4, -4.00oz, -1.86in</li>            <!--I love this gun way too much, even tho its an NPC meta weapon-->
      <li>Underbarrel: Phase-3 Grip,  +0.72oz, -0.32in</li>   <!--The phase 3 is my favourite-->
      <li>Magazine: 45 round mag</li>
      <li>Barrel: RCQ-7, +0.37lb, +0.32in</li>
    </ul></p></li>
    </ol>
